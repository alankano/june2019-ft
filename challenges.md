# Week 0 | Extra Challenges

The students who have finished their prework before June 24th or the students who
are still working at their prework but have finished the activities planned for the day
are invited to complete the challenges below.

Keep in mind that the challenges are meant to be challenging! They'll help you to have a deeper understanding of the concepts learned during the prework. **Feeling stuck?**
Don't forget the 4 steps discussed of how you can ask for help.

### Correlation Isn't Causation

Can you explain the difference between correlation and causation? Do you know
why this difference is important? In this challenge, we invite you to deep dive
into the concept of spurious correlations.

A spurious correlation occurs when two or more variables are statistically related
(i. e., the fluctuation of one variable is strongly predictable by the fluctuation of another),
but they aren't really related. This usually happens because of unseen factors,
that is, variables that aren't on your analysis.
